# Background

This public repository is intended to be one stop solution for learning about APIs related to Citrix stack data. It aims to cover data/APIs for all types of: 
- interfaces (pull / push)
- underlying components (monitor / analytics) 
- deployment modes (on-prem / cloud / hybrid)
- focus areas (monitoring / performance / security)
- complexity (basic / intermediate / advanced)

The approach taken is use-case and example driven so that consumers can quickly get to the outcome (data) they need to with minimal effort by copy pasting working/tested snippets. 

The examples cover a wide variety of consumers / clients to suit the different types of personas that may be working with these. 

The goal is to keep adding more content here over time to increase the value and appeal to consumers of Citrix data.
